# Purpose of this folder:

Allowing a general network to learn a representation may be
better than having to teach every individual model learn representation
from state image. That is having a VAE simplify the environment then
feed the embedding to networks rather than feeding each network 
raw state image input.

The end goal here is to maybe make something similar to a World Model
